## Dependencies

- [QBCore](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-core)
- [PS-Dispatch](https://github.com/Project-Sloth/ps-dispatch) [If you intend to use it, make sure this starts before the mdt!]
- [Ox MySQL](https://github.com/overextended/oxmysql)

## FAQ
- **How do I add charges to a criminal in an Incident?** - After finding and adding the criminal citizen to the incident, right-click in the space under the criminal's name and select "Add Charge".


- **My dispatch calls are not being populated?** - You have not started the dispatch resource before the mdt or renamed the dispatch resource name and not made the necessary changes in mdt to reflect that.
